    <h1>  ABOUT PALAKKAD </h1>
    <br>
    <p> Palakkad lies at the foot of the Western Ghats on the Kerala-Tamil Nadu border. Coimbatore is just 50 km away from Palakkad. The district known for its historical background has the remnants of the fort of Tipu Sultan. Lined with mountains, forests, rivulets and mountain streams, Palakkad is where you will find nature at its natural best. </p>
    <br>
    <p> Palakkad is a land of palm trees and paddy fields. Rich in flora and fauna, Palakkad has probably the biggest mountain pass in the world (30-40 Kms) separating the two folds of the Western Ghats on the border of Kerala with Tamil Nadu.</p>
    <br>
    <p> The soil is fertile and is favourable for agriculture. The district is even described as the granary of the state of Kerala. Palakkad also has many dams and irrigation projects such as Walayar, Malampuzha, Pothundy, and Parambikulam. </p>

                <p> The fort built in 1766 by Hyder Ali is one of the well preserved forts of Kerala. The fort was captured by the British in 1784. It was later taken by the troops of the Kozhikode Zamorin but was recaptured by the British again in 1790. Tipu Sultan did not give up easily and he fought continuously for the custody of the fort. However, during one such encounter he lost his life. Since then the fort is known as Tipu Sultan’s Fort.  </p>

                <br>
                <p> The legend behind this temple is what makes it special. According to the myth, Perumthachan, an expert carpenter began constructing this temple after being challenged to build a temple that could challenge heaven. Lord Indra truly got envious of the temple and altered minute measurements of the temple which in turn would disrupt Perumthachan’s work. This went on for months until an exasperated Perumthachan gave up on the task and decided to end his career as a carpenter. At the temple one can see a measuring scale and axe lieing inserted into a wall of the temple, which has unfinished structures and pillars. </p>
