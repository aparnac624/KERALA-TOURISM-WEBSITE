    <br>
    <p> Also known as the cultural capital of Kerala, Thrissur is the land of the famous Thrissurpooram held during April-May. The much awaited festival attracts people from all over the world, enthralling them with the sight of 30 beautifully caparisoned elephants lined up in front of the majestic Vadakkumnathan Temple. A district that has kept alive its traditional art forms is also home to a number of pilgrimage centres.  </p>
    <br>
    <p> The term Thrissur is the abbreviated form of the original name Thrissivaperur which means the town of the sacred Shiva. Built on an elevated ground, at the apex of Thrissur Circle, is the famous Vadakkumnathan Temple. Thrissur was also known as Vrishabhadripuram and Ten Kailasam in the ancient days.  </p>
    <br>
    <p> Thrissur is a district rich in cultural heritage. The district can also claim to have played a significant part in fostering the trade relations between Kerala and the outside world in the ancient and medieval period. </p>
