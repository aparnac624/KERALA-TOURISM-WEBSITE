You can also take a walk across the beach road course to the Dolphin’s Point during dawn to get a glimpse of the leaping dolphins.  </p>

The Malayala Kalagramam, a centre of fine arts that teaches various forms of dance, music, sculpting, yoga and meditation is a sought after destination for those willing to learn the arts.

                <p> Snuggled cozily in the Western Ghats, are the gurgling waterfalls of Thusharagiri. Thushargiri, literally means the snow capped mountains. The three waterfalls on the backdrop of the Western Ghats provide an exhilarating and spellbinding sight to the visitor, in its full glory from September to November. Two streams originating from the Western Ghats meet here to form the Chalippuzha River. The river diverges into three waterfalls creating a snowy spray, which gives the name, 'Thusharagiri'. Of the three, the highest waterfall is Thenpara, which falls from an altitude of 75 metres.  </p>
